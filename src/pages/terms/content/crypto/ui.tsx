          CLIMAR LIMITED is a company organised under the laws of Ireland with
          registration number 758159, and having its registered address at UNIT
          3D NORTH POINT HOUSE, NORTH POINT, BUSINESS PARK, NEW MALLOW ROAD

        </li>
        <li>
          RIDM has created an NFT Checkout service (the “Platform”) through
          which customers in the European Economic Area can access and purchase
          non-fungible tokens which digitally represent artwork (“NFT”). The
          Platform only serves the purpose of selling NFTs to Consumers by
          facilitating card transactions of NFTs listed for sale on third-party
          NFT points of sale selected by RIDM via the Platform. Through the
          Platform, RIDM does not hold any cryptocurrency or Token on behalf of
          any user, nor processes any payment or crypto-to-fiat/fiat-to-crypto
          exchange from or to users. The Platform is solely permitting RIDM to
          resell NFTs listed on third-party NFT Marketplaces to Users in order
          to enable the Users to purchase NFTs with Credit/Debit Cards.
        </li>
        <li>
          These Terms and Conditions apply between us and you as a user of the
          Platform ("Consumer",”user”, "you" or "your"). When connecting your
          EVM wallet to the Platform to use the Platform, you accept the Terms
          and Conditions regarding the use of the Platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          These Terms and Conditions together with RIDM's privacy policy (the
          "Privacy Policy") form a legal agreement (the "Agreement") between you
          and RIDM, governing your use of the Platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          To access the RIDM Platform you need an internet connection, a
          computer, a smartphone or a tablet with a web browser (as applicable).
        </li>
        <li>
          You may only use the Platform for your personal use and in accordance
          with the Agreement. The Agreement is for an indefinite term, meaning
          that it will continue in force until you or RIDM terminate it, in
          accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          The language of the Agreement is English and all communications will
          be conducted in English unless otherwise stated in the Terms and
          Conditions. You can at all times download a copy of these Terms and

      <h2>Disclaimers & risks associated with the platform</h2>
      <div className={styles.divider} />
      <ul>
        <li>The access to and use of the Platform is at your own risk.</li>
        <li>
          NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the
          associated blockchain (e.g., ethereum network). Any transfer or sales
          occur on the associated blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon or
          Solana). Therefore, RIDM cannot affect or otherwise control the
          transfer of title or right in any NFTs or underlying or associated
          content or items.
        </li>
        <li>By using the Platform, you accept and acknowledge that :</li>
        <li>the value of an NFT is subjective;</li>
        <li>NFTs shall not be considered as a safe investment;</li>
        <li>
          RIDM or the Platform cannot control events of liquidation of NFTs;
        </li>
        <li>
          prices of NFTs are subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price
          of cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect NFT prices;
        </li>
        <li>
          you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and that you may
          lose money;
        </li>
        <li>
          a lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of
          distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of
          those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also
          negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs.
        </li>
        <li>
          the regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible
          tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and
          new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the
          development of the service and the utility of NFTs.
        </li>
        <li>
          you are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply
          to your transactions and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the
          correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. RIDM is
          not responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting,
          or remitting the taxes that apply to your NFTs.
        </li>
        <li>
          there are risks associated with purchasing items associated with
          content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions,
          including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit
          items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay,
          items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become
          untransferable. you represent and warrant that you have done
          sufficient research before making any decisions to obtain, transfer,
          or otherwise interact with any NFTs or accounts/collections.
        </li>
        <li>
          RIDM does not control the public blockchains that you are interacting
          with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that
          may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on these
          public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are
          irreversible and RIDM has no ability to reverse any transactions on
          the blockchain.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are risks associated with using internet and blockchain based
          products, including, but not limited to, the risk associated with
          hardware, software, and internet connections, the risk of malicious
          software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain
          unauthorised access to your third-party wallet or account.
        </li>
        <li>
          RIDM reserves the right to disable the possibility to use the Platform
          for purchasing certain collections, contracts, and NFTs affected by
          any of these issues or by other issues. NFTs you purchase may become
          inaccessible on RIDM. Under no circumstances shall the inability to
          view items on RIDM or an inability to use the service in conjunction
          with the purchase, sale, or transfer of items available on any
          blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against RIDM.

      </ul>
      <div className={styles.divider} />

        and functional EVM compatible wallet for using the Platform. For more
        information about the supported wallets on the Platform, please visit

        the blockchain to which the NFT was minted initially (the “Associated
        Blockchain”). The Platform only allows for facilitating transactions of
        NFTs either on the SOLANA, ETHEREUM or the POLYGON blockchain. Two types
        of EVM wallets are supported on the Platform:{" "}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Phantom Wallets: they allow for holding and transacting NFTs on the
          Solana Blockchain. For the use of Phantom Wallets on the Platform,
          Metmask’s Wallets Terms of Service apply: https://phantom.app/terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Metamask Wallets: they allow for holding and transacting NFTs on the

        </li>
      </ul>
      <div className={styles.divider} />
      <p>
        RIDM provides the users with a Platform offering to users the
        possibility to buy NFTs listed on third-party NFT points of sale which
        are selected by RIDM. However, when users decide to enter into a
        transaction for purchasing an NFT via the Platform, Users enter into a
        purchase agreement regarding the NFT selected with RIDM. Each NFT for
        sale on the Platform is characterised by a Contract Address and a Token
        ID, which collectively allow to uniquely identify each NFT. The
        essential characteristics of each NFT for sale on the Platform are
        available in the blockchain description of each NFT accessible via the
        NFT contract address/Token ID disclosed on the Platform. When the user
        purchases an NFT on the Platform, RIDM shall ensure delivery of the NFT
        ordered by the user with the corresponding Contract Address and the
        Token ID as disclosed initially in the description page of the NFT
        ordered by the user to the Wallet connected by the user on the Platform.
        Unless otherwise provided in the blockchain description of an NFT for
        sale on the Platform, the purchase of an NFT on the Platform does not
        include any assignment of Intellectual Property rights relating to the
        NFT or to the content of the NFT purchased. Delivery of NFTs purchased
        on the Platform is ensured via a blockchain transaction of the NFT
        between the third-party seller of the NFT to the wallet address of the
        EVM wallet connected by the user to the Platform. Delivery times of NFTs
        purchased on the Platform are subject to blockchain processing times and
        thus, may vary from time-to-time. Users are responsible for paying the
        price of any NFTs purchased on the Platform at the price disclosed at
        the final payment confirmation page.
      </p>
      <div className={styles.divider} />
      <p>
        As disclaimed in section 2.3 above, RIDM does not control the
        blockchains that you are interacting with, plus, blockchain transactions
        are irreversible and RIDM has no ability to reverse any transactions on
        the blockchain. A “Refund” shall mean the restitution of any amount paid
        by the User to the User and the cancellation of any NFT transaction in
        part or in full which was initiated in consideration for the amount
        restituted to the User. However, the user shall only be eligible to
        Refunds on the Platform in the following cases:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The user has initiated a purchase on the Platform of an NFT which
            was simultaneously purchased by another user on the Platform or on
            the third-party NFT Marketplace; or
          </li>
          <li>
            The user has initiated a purchase of NFT on the Platform while the
            associated Blockchain of the NFT purchased is simultaneously turned
            off which disables the capacity to finalise the NFT transaction; or
          </li>
          <li>
            The Blockchain processing fees associated with the transaction of a
            selected NFT by the user have increased by more than 150% between
            the selection of the NFT by the user on the Platform and the payment
            of the Fees for the NFT by the user.
          </li>
        </ul>
        For any questions or requests regarding Refunds of purchases of NFTs
        made on the Platform, the user shall contact the Customer Support as
        provided for in section 4.1 below. Upon confirmation by RIDM or the
        Customer Support that a Refund has been granted, the user shall be
        refunded within 10 days. A “Chargeback” shall mean the return of funds
        to a customer's associated Credit Card or Debit Card account after the
        user disputes a card payment on their card statement. Chargebacks may
        only be triggered in cases of disputes of a transaction successfully
        carried out where the user purchased NFTs on the Platform with a Credit
        Card or a Debit Card as described in section 6.4(a) below. The
        initiation of Chargebacks is subject to the provisions of the Terms of
        Service of the user’s Bank, Credit card or Debit Card provider, RIDM
        shall be liable to cooperate with the user’s Bank, Credit card or Debit
        Card provider in order to ensure the effective processing of the
        approved Chargeback requests.
