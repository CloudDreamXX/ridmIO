        Under Applicable Data Protection Laws, you have certain rights in
        relation to the processing of your personal data. We process your

        Please submit requests for exercising your rights by contacting us on

      <p>
        You have, under certain circumstances, the right to exercise the
        following rights:
      </p>
      <h3>Access</h3>
      <p>
        You may request confirmation whether or not personal data is processed
        and, if that is the case, access your personal data and additional
        information such as the purposes of the processing. You are also
        entitled to receive a copy of the personal data undergoing processing.
        If the request is made by electronic means the information will be
        provided in a commonly used electronic format if you do not request
        otherwise.

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>
              <h3>Object to certain processing</h3>
              <p>
                You have the right to object to the processing of your personal
                data based on a legitimate interest for reasons which concern
                your particular situation. In such a situation, we will stop
                using your personal data where the processing is based on a
                legitimate interest, unless we can show that the interest
                overrides your privacy interest or that the use of your personal
                data is necessary in order to manage or defend legal claims.
              </p>
            </th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
      </table>
      <h3>Rectification</h3>
      <p>
        You have at any time the right to have inaccurate personal data
        rectified, as well as, taking into account the purposes of processing,
        the right to have incomplete personal data completed which relates to
        you.
      </p>
      <h3>Erasure</h3>
      <p>
        You may have your personal data erased under certain circumstances, such
        as when your personal data is no longer needed for the purposes for
        which it was collected. However, we cannot delete your personal data if
        we e.g. are obligated under law to keep the data.
      </p>
      <h3>Restriction of processing</h3>
      <p>
        You may ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data to only
        comprise storage of your personal data under certain circumstances, such
        as when the processing is unlawful, but you do not want your personal
        data erased. If the processing of your personal data has been restricted
        we may only, besides storing the data, process your personal data with
        your consent, in order to establish, exercise or defend legal claims or
        to defend rights of others.
      </p>
      <h3>Withdrawal of consent</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to at any time withdraw your consent to processing of
        personal data to the extent the processing is based on your consent.
      </p>
      <h3>Data Portability</h3>
      <p>
        You may ask to receive a machine-readable copy of the personal data
        processed on the basis of your consent or on the basis that the
        processing is necessary in order to perform an agreement with you, and
        which personal data have been provided to RIDM by you (data portability)
        and ask for the information to be transferred to another data controller
        (where possible).
