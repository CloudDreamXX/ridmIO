      <div className={styles.divider} />
      <p>
        A happyCOINS Account ("Account" or "Accounts") is an Account held by an
        "Account Holder" with the specific objective of exchanging digital
        currency (like bitcoin) and fiat currency through the happyCOINS
        platform.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        An "Account Holder" can be any natural person who enters into an
        agreement with Digital Currency Services B.V. under these Terms of Use.
        The Terms of Use and other stipulations it refers to (such as Privacy
        Policy and AML Policy) relate to all rights and obligations arising from
        the use of this Site and the Services. Each natural person wishing to
        register as an Account Holder is advised to read these Terms of Use
        carefully and understand them before final acceptance. These Terms of
        Use apply as long as the respective Account is accessible through the
        platform www.happyCOINS.com.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        By Creating an Account to use the happyCOINS Services, Account Holders
        represent and warrant:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>they have accepted these Terms of Use; and</li>
        <li>
          they are at least 18 years of age and have the full capacity to accept

        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        happyCOINS works with accounts to provide you with additional security.
        It also gives you a 'one-click' ordering method, which speeds up the
        process and helps avoiding errors (such as making a mistake when typing
        the digital currency address of your private wallet). Your account is
        only used for these purposes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A new Account can be created by any natural person with an e-mail
        address, a digital currency wallet address, an Euro bank account in the
        Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and EU residence. Before an Account is
        activated the identity of the account holder will be verified by
        happyCOINS (upload of photo of ID-card or passport, pdf or photo of bank
        statement, photo of crypto wallet; confirmed with a video chat).
        Together with the Account Code (a unique alphanumeric code which
        identifies the Account) these details are considered the "Account
        Details".

          Account Holders are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of

          that occur under their Account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Account Holders agree to provide happyCOINS with accurate, current and
          complete information as prompted by the Create Account process.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Account Holder provides the IBAN bank account number on which
          happyCOINS can payout any digital currencies that are sold.
        </li>
        <li>
          Account Holders also provide the name as used with the bank account to

        </li>
        <li>
          Account Holders will provide one of their private digital currency
          wallet addresses to happyCOINS where happyCOINS can send or return
          digital currency to the Account Holder (digital currency Return
          address).
        </li>
        <li>
          happyCOINS cannot be held responsible for the loss of digital
          currencies resulting from an Account Holder not being able to access
          their personal wallet and/or digital currency address(es) which they
          provided to happyCOINS to be used by happyCOINS for sending (or
          returning) digital currency to the Account Holder.
        </li>
        <li>
          happyCOINS will provide one specific digital currency address per

        </li>
        <li>
          It is possible to create and use multiple concurrent Accounts per
          Account Holder.
        </li>
        <li>
          When buying or selling digital currencies through the happyCOINS
          Exchange Service, AccountHolders are buying from, or selling to,
          happyCOINS directly. happyCOINS does not act as an intermediary or
          marketplace between other buyers and sellers of digital currencies.
          The Exchange Service is subject to the happyCOINS "Reference Price".
          "Reference Price" means the liquidity adjusted price of a given
          digital currency amount in terms of local currency as quoted on the
          happyCOINS Site. The "Reference Price" is stated either as a "Buy
          Price", the price in terms of local currency at which you purchase
          digital currency from happyCOINS, or as a "Sell Price", the price in
          terms of local currency at which you sell digital currency to
          happyCOINS. For the purpose of any transaction which incorporates the
          "Reference Price", you agree, as a condition of using the happyCOINS
          exchange services, to accept the "Reference Price" as the sole
          conversion metric.
        </li>
        <li>
          Account Holders acknowledge and agree that the digital currencies
          price is based on the happyCOINS Reference Price. Volatile market
          conditions and API delays can affect the Reference Price, both
          positive and negative, for which happyCOINS cannot be hold
          responsible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Account Holders also acknowledge and agree that the payment in
          relation to the transaction may be delayed due to availability of
          banking systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Due to the inherent nature of the digital currencies networks, Account
          Holders also acknowledge and agree that sending or returning digital
          currencies to their Account may take between one (1) hour and
          twenty-four (24) hours, barring unforeseen or unavoidable network
          issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          happyCOINS reserves the right to abort a transaction at any time and
          to return received payments or digital currencies to the Account
          Holder. Digital currencies are only returned after happyCOINS received
          at least 6 transaction confirmations.

      <h2>Services</h2>
      <div className={styles.divider} />
      <p>
        Our Services consist of facilitating the buying and selling of digital
        currencies such as Bitcoins and their use to purchase goods in an
        international open payment system. happyCOINS does not keep or manage
        any digital currency wallets and/or Euro deposits. The Services provided
        by the Company are currently regulated in The Netherlands and it is our
        policy to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding AML and
        identity verification (know your customer / KYC procedures), and to
        detect and prevent the use of our Services for money laundering or to
        facilitate criminal or terrorist activities. Accordingly, the Company
        has implemented an Anti-Money Laundering and Identity Verification
        Policy: AML Policy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For the avoidance of doubt we do not provide any investment advice in
        connection with the Services contemplated by these Terms of Use. We may
        provide information on the price, range, volatility of digital
        currencies and events that have affected the price of these, but this is
        not considered investment advice and should not be construed as such.
        Any decision to purchase or sell digital currency is your decision and
        we will not be liable for any loss suffered.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        happyCOINS is a stand-alone digital currency exchange business, where
        you deal directly with happyCOINS (as opposed to an exchange market
        where you deal directly with other buyers and sellers). The costs for a
        transaction through the happyCOINS platform consist of a service fee and
        a bank fee. These fees are clearly specified on the Buy and Sell pages
        and are presented well in advance of initiating your order. Digital
        currencies such as Bitcoins are a digital non-returnable and
        non-refundable product for which you lose your right of withdrawal.

      <h3>Buy digital currencies: via online instant payment service</h3>
      <div className={styles.divider}></div>
      <p>
        happyCOINS supports various international online instant and card
        payment services.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A buy transaction is initiated after your payment notification has
          been received from our payment service provider and is processed by
          happyCOINS. The digital currency will be sent to the digital currency
          address of your wallet after finishing the buy transaction (usually
          within minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
          The digital currency price for your transaction will be locked in for
          a short period, so you know exactly how much digital currency you will
          receive. If your payment takes more than the lock in period to
          finalise, your digital currency price will be updated with the
          happyCOINS Reference Price at the time of receiving your payment
          signal. In that case the final amount of digital currency sent to your
          wallet may differ slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          The minimum and maximum transaction sizes depend on the status (trust
          level) of your Account and are visible after you have submitted your
          Account Code on the Buy page.
        </li>
        <li>
          You expressly acknowledge that digital currencies are a digital
          non-returnable and non-refundable product for which the delivery is
          initiated instantly following your payment confirmation and for which
          your right of withdrawal is not applicable.

      <h3>Buy digital currencies: via SEPA Euro bank transfers</h3>
      <div className={styles.divider} />
      <p>
        When buying digital currency by SEPA bank transfer, you acknowledge and
        agree to accept:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          That you will be provided with the details of the happyCOINS bank
          account after clicking the review order button on the Buy page.
        </li>
        <li>
          SEPA bank transfers are processed daily after receiving a notification
          from our bank of your transfer. Expect a lead time of one to three
          working days between your bank transfer and receiving the digital
          currency in your wallet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Initiate your SEPA transfer from the bank account connected to your
          happyCOINS Account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put your happyCOINS Account code in the 'comment' (sometimes called
          'label' or 'reference') field of the bank transaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only transfer Euro amounts within the limits of your happyCOINS
          Account.
        </li>
        <li>
          happyCOINS uses a minimal transaction amount and a maximum amount
          depending on the verification level of your happyCOINS Account.
        </li>
        <li>
          After your SEPA bank transfer, it usually takes 1-3 working days to
          show on our bank account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once our bank confirms your transfer, we initiate a buy transaction
          and the digital currency will be sent to your wallet.
        </li>
        <li>
          The estimated amount of digital currency on the Buy page is based on
          the actual price at that moment.
        </li>
        <li>
          The final amount of digital currency you receive will differ from the
          estimate as the price is determined when your order is actually
          traded.
        </li>
        <li>
          When your digital currency is sent to your wallet you will receive a
          confirmation email with the financial transaction details.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bank transfers not in line with these terms will be returned (after
          deduction of bank costs).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div className={styles.divider} />
      <h3>Sell Digital currencies</h3>
      <div className={styles.divider} />
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you initiate a Sell transaction through the form on the Sell page,
          the digital currency price for your transaction will be locked in for
          a short period, so you know exactly what your payout will be. If your
          transaction takes more than the lock in period to finalise, your
          digital currency price will be updated with the happyCOINS reference
          sell price at the time of receiving your digital currency.
          Alternatively if you don't use the Sell form to lock your digital
          currency price, your digital currency will automatically be traded
          when happyCOINS receives them. Your payout is then based on our market
          reference price of that moment.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a minimum digital currency sell transaction size and a
          maximum daily, monthly or lifetime digital currency sell volume
          limitation per customer. When happyCOINS receives a digital currency
          deposit from an Account Holder with a digital currency volume below
          the minimum size or above the daily, monthly or lifetime limit, the
          digital currency is automatically returned to the digital currency
          return address of the Account. In this case the returning digital
          currency volume will be reduced with a small administrative fee. When
          the return volume is less than the administrative fee, there are no
          digital currency returned.
        </li>
        <li>
          The current minimum sell transaction sizes and maximum daily volume
          depend on your Account status and are visible after submitting your
          Account Code on the Sell page.
        </li>
        <li>
          After receiving and trading your digital currency (at least 3
          confirmations required), happyCOINS initiates payout to your bank
          account on working days at 12:00 (CET).
        </li>
        <li>
          Depending on the bank the payment is available on the Account Holder's
          bank account the same day, next working-day or the working-day after
          that.
        </li>
