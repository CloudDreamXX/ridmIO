        <li>
          RIDM may, at its discretion, notify the End-user of the impending
          termination and provide a reasonable timeframe for the withdrawal of
          remaining balances unless prohibited by law or regulatory
          restrictions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Upon termination, the User’s access to the Platform, User Account, and
          related Virtual Asset Services shall be permanently revoked. Any
          remaining balances must be withdrawn before the effective termination
          date unless regulatory restrictions or unresolved disputes prevent
          such withdrawal. RIDM retains the right to withhold funds if required
          by applicable laws, regulatory requirements, or ongoing
          investigations.
